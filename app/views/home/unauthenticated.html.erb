<!-- 
I created this site because I remember how I turned homework in during college.
I ran to the library before class, printed out an essay, and put it at the front desk before class.
Some teachers let me submit homework via e-mail, which usually included an attachment that was ultimately printed out and marked up by the teacher.

What if this entire process could be done online?
